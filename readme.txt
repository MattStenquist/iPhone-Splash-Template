Thanks for downloading or atleast checking out the iPhone 
Splash Page Template!

This template is free to use and in anyway shape or form is yours to alter.
I've just provided the "framework", if you will, for you to alter and play
around with. 

The template is all coded in CSS3, and uses HTML5 markup. 

The background is a gradient that is coded into the style, same with the 
buttons. All you have to do is tweak the colors to your liking.

As well the iPhone image is being loaded directly on top of the iPhone case
which isn't draggable because it's being loaded in via CSS.

All you have to do is change the image which is 240 x 359 pixels.


Thanks, Matt.
